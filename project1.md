## Project description

This project is a hangman game.

## How to compile and run the program

- Install c++
- Clone the repository
- open the command prompt and navigate to the project files
- run "./a.exe"

## UI Design

The program validates input from the user and ensures and compares to a randomly selected string, included in the phrases.txt file. It rates each phrase on difficulty based on the number of unique characters the user would have to guess. Once the user guesses, it either unveils the letter, or stores it in the wrong guesses and begins to draw the gallows. Once the game is lost or won, the user can choose to play again or exit the program.
