## Project description

This was our final project for CSCI 325 and is a text based RPG where users must defeat enemies and gain xp to finally defeat the final boss.

## How to run the program

- Install Java
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Open with vsCode
- Open the terminal
- Click Run without debugging.
- Play game in the vscode terminal.

## UI Design

This game uses text input and menus for the player to navigate using the terminal. The code displays knowledge of object oriented programming, as there are many different classes of character and enemy. It also displays 
some knowledge of game theory, wherein the different random numbers generated for damage received and given take into account different factors such as armor, strength, intellect, speed, and other attributes.
